# BoxOfficePrediction
We‚Äôll delve into movie budget and revenue data. This dataset provides an excellent opportunity to explore new tools, such as scikit-learn for linear regression, and seaborn‚Äîa popular data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.‚Äù üé¨üìä

Let‚Äôs explore whether higher film budgets correlate with increased box office revenue by analyzing movie budgets and their financial performance data.

# Key Takeaways

1. **Data Cleaning with Nested Loops:**
   - We learned how to use nested loops to clean data by removing unwanted characters from multiple columns.

2. **Filtering DataFrames with .loc[] and .query():**
   - We explored how to filter Pandas DataFrames based on multiple conditions using both `.loc[]` and `.query()` methods.

3. **Creating Bubble Charts with Seaborn:**
   - We discovered how to create bubble charts using the Seaborn library, which allows us to visualize relationships between three variables.

4. **Styling Seaborn Charts:**
   - We explored styling options for Seaborn charts, including pre-built styles and modifying Matplotlib parameters.

5. **Converting Years to Decades with Floor Division:**
   - We used floor division (integer division) to convert years into decades, a common preprocessing step.

6. **Linear Regression with Seaborn:**
   - We learned how to superimpose linear regressions over our data using Seaborn.

7. **Evaluating Regression Models:**
   - We discussed how to judge the quality of a regression model based on how well it fits the data and the R-squared metric.

8. **Scikit-learn for Regression:**
   - Finally, we ran regressions using scikit-learn and calculated regression coefficients.
